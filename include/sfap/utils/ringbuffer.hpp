  \brief Single-producer single-consumer ring buffer of bytes.

  \invariant `size() + free() == capacity()`.
  \invariant Capacity is a power of two. Indexing uses `mask_`.

  \par Thread-safety
  - Safe for one producer thread and one consumer thread concurrently.
  - Not safe for multiple producers or multiple consumers.
  - No blocking. No dynamic allocation in steady state.

  \par Exceptions
  All functions are `noexcept`. No exceptions are thrown.

  \par Complexity
  - `put()`/`pop()` amortized O(1).
  - `prepare_*`/`commit_*` O(1).
